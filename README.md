# Orbital Engine

_This is an old project that I am no longer working on._

This is a simple java applet which allows gravity simulations on rigid spherical bodies. *Disclaimer: It was my first Java project - it's a bit of a mess.*

This project was a way for me to get familiar with Java and creating GUIs (from scratch).
